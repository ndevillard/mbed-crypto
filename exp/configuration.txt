Top-level configuration for PSA Crypto Library

Topics should be available by crypto domain: hash, cipher, asymmetric
For each topic, a list of candidate functions must be available.
For each candidate function, several options are possible: 
    - Reference implementation (default), optimized for legibility
    - Formally-proven implementation if available
    - Optimized for minimal flash or RAM size, if available
    - Accelerated by hardware
    - Delegated to secure element

This probably implies that secure elements and hardware accelerators are
configured separately so they automatically show up in the right places in
PSA.

Do we need to tag implementations to they appear in configuration choices
as [] Legible [] Optimized for speed on Arm, etc.?

Make menuconfig should appear like this:

Topics
    Low-level routines
        [ ] Hash functions
            [ ] SHA-1
                [ ] Use reference implementation
                [ ] Use formally-proven implementation
                [ ] Optimized for minimal flash size
                [ ] Optimized for minimal RAM usage
                [ ] Use NEON acceleration (Arm)
                [ ] Accelerated by XXX

            [ ] SHA-2 224

            ...
    
    Constructs
        [ ] MAC
            -> Select which hash functions to apply to
        [ ] HMAC
            -> Select which hash functions to apply to
        [ ] AEAD
            -> Select with cipher/hash functions to apply to
        [ ] Asymmetric signature
            -> Select hash and padding


Could also have a higher-level configuration that tries to pick the best
options overall for a given use case, e.g.
- I need TLS PSK with AES-128 accelerated by Arm instructions
- I need AES-256 and SHA2 for secure storage
- ...
