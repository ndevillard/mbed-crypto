This directory holds experiments around crypto hardware support.
Not meant for actual use in production.

# Objective
Provide a PSA Crypto implementation running in the secure world.
The top-level API should be available for other secure-world applications.
Crypto routines running underneath could possibly come from several
sources:

- Pure software implementations, optimized for legibility, or speed, or
  size, or formal proofs
- Software implementations making use of processor crypto instructions
- Based on hardware acceleration modules
- Outsourcing all or part of the calls to external secure elements

The build system should allow users to cherry-pick the version they want to
compile.

# Key Management

# Extensions
This is only the crypto-core. In order to export crypto services to the
normal world, an additional layer is needed to handle communication and
message passing between secure and normal worlds. This layer will be highly
dependent on the interface layer between the two worlds and left for later
versions.
