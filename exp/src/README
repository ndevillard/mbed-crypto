This directory contains all top-level PSA functions.
In general these do not perform any actual crypto but re-direct to
wherever the fun actually takes place: behind the NSPE/SPE wall, in a
secure element, in a crypto hardware accelerator, or by picking one of
possibly several candidate software implementations.

It is not yet clear whether those functions could be automatically generated
at build time.
